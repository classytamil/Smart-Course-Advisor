# ðŸŽ“ Smart Course Advisor (Streamlit + ML)

This project is a **Smart Course Advisor** that predicts whether a student is eligible to take the **next course level** based on:
- Quiz Score  
- Time Spent on the course  
- Completion Status  

The app provides **personalized suggestions** and feedback using a trained **Random Forest model**.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- âœ… Predicts **next course eligibility**  
- âœ… Inputs: `quiz_score`, `time_spent`, `completion_status`  
- âœ… Outputs personalized advice (eligible, revise, improve, etc.)  
- âœ… Simple **Streamlit UI** with sidebar inputs  
- âœ… Trained with **synthetic dataset**

```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Main dependencies:

* `streamlit`
* `scikit-learn`
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `joblib`

Example `requirements.txt`:

```txt
streamlit
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
joblib
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The model was trained on a **synthetic dataset** with columns:

* `quiz_score` â†’ studentâ€™s quiz score (0â€“100)
* `time_spent` â†’ total hours spent on the course
* `completion_status` â†’ Completed / Incomplete (binary encoded)
* `next_level` â†’ Target variable (1 = Eligible, 0 = Not Eligible)

---

## ðŸ§  Model Training

The model used is a **Random Forest Classifier** trained with synthetic student performance data.
It is saved as `model/student_model.pkl` and loaded into the Streamlit app.
